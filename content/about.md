I've been slowly working towards building a site for myself, with multiple years breaks - having kids slows things down.
I'll probably focus around a few main tags, and I'll work on keeping reference of those here.  I consider myself 
moderately technical, but this is not my day job - I work in financial services, but I won't be discussing that.  I'll mostly talk about questions that interest me, and any technology I use to answer those questions.


The proximate cause of getting this working is that I've been working on some local coronavirus data,
but I am curious about local (Morris County, NJ, USA) data, so I want a place to collect all the info I go through.

### LTS
One concept I really want to try to keep going is having [LTS](/tags/lts/) as in long-term support posts, where I keep things updated that I will be continaully working on.  For instance, I'll keep my [Tech Setup](/post/tech-setup/) page
